# WRIG
WRIG is a Relative Information Gain based Query Performance Prediction Framework with Automatically Generated Query Variants.
The entire project is comprised of a number of sub-modules -
1. **InteractionMatrix** (developed with Java) 
2. **RerankByDRMM** (written in Python) 
3. **QPPEval** (in Java)
4. **GenerateQueryVariants** (in Java) and
5. **WRIG** (in Python)

## Requirements

## Guide to use
**Step-1:** Download TREC-Robust [java index and word vectors](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13k0AFcIemmtBvBpaBCyJR7ZYUIoRf2Kx?usp=sharing) here.

**Step-2:** Create a [conda environment](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-anaconda-ubuntu-18-04-or-20-04) 
and activate it using the command - 
> conda activate <environment_name>

**Step-3:** Check all the packages listed above using correct version of your pip -
> pip list

In case required packages are missing, install the right version in your current conda environment by running -
> pip install <package-name>

There is a top level bash script **wrig.sh**.
